To run the CanteensApp, please follow the steps below:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. The application was developed using Python 3.11.5, so it is recommended to use this version.

2. Install the necessary Python packages by running the following command in the terminal:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Navigate to the 'Homework2/CanteensApp' directory in the terminal.

4. Start the GUI application by running the following command in the terminal:
    python GUI.py

This will automatically start the API server and the Flask server in the background.

5. The application should now be running and you can interact with it through the GUI.

Please note that the API server and the Flask server must be running for the GUI application to work properly. If you close the GUI application, the servers will also be closed.
