# Quadratic Equation Solver
This Python package, named "Quadratic Equation Solver", is designed to solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. 

The package contains a single function, `quadratic_solver`, which takes three arguments, `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the coefficients of the quadratic equation, and returns `x1` and `x2`, the two solutions to the equation. If the equation has no real solutions, the function will return `None`.
